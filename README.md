This project aims to create a digital signage application where a playlist of videos are displayed across seperate networks on multiple devices. These devices autmatically sync to the remote FTP server if any updates are pushed to the file directory.
The video player, remote syncing and GUI all work perfectly standalone, however, when combined togethor the application crashes when play is pressed on the GUI.
